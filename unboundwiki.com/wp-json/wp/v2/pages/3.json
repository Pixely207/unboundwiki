This wiki is managed by Dashing Media, Inc. with open contributors who are paid for their contributions to this wiki.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Media<\/h2>\n<p>All media is contributed directly by players who capture their own screenshots from the game.

Mediavine serves content and advertisements when you visit the Website, which may use first and third-party cookies. A cookie is a small text file which is sent to your computer or mobile device (referred to in this policy as a \u201cdevice\u201d) by the web server so that a website can remember some information about your browsing activity on the Website.<\/p>\n<p>First party cookies are created by the website that you are visiting. A third-party cookie is frequently used in behavioral advertising and analytics and is created by a domain other than the website you are visiting. Third-party cookies, tags, pixels, beacons and other similar technologies (collectively, \u201cTags\u201d) may be placed on the Website to monitor interaction with advertising content and to target and optimize advertising. Each internet browser has functionality so that you can block both first and third-party cookies and clear your browser\u2019s cache. The &#8220;help&#8221; feature of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies, how to disable existing cookies and how to clear your browser\u2019s cache. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.allaboutcookies.org\/manage-cookies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">All About Cookies<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of the Website content and features. Please note that rejecting cookies does not mean that you will no longer see ads when you visit our Site. In the event you opt-out, you will still see non-personalized advertisements on the Website.<\/p>\n<p>The Website collects the following data using a cookie when serving personalized ads:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>IP Address<\/li>\n<li>Operating System type<\/li>\n<li>Operating System version<\/li>\n<li>Device Type<\/li>\n<li>Language of the website<\/li>\n<li>Web browser type<\/li>\n<li>Email (in hashed form)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Mediavine Partners (companies listed below with whom Mediavine shares data) may also use this data to link to other end user information the partner has independently collected to deliver targeted advertisements. Mediavine Partners may also separately collect data about end users from other sources, such as advertising IDs or pixels, and link that data to data collected from Mediavine publishers in order to provide interest-based advertising across your online experience, including devices, browsers and apps. This data includes usage data, cookie information, device information, information about interactions between users and advertisements and websites, geolocation data, traffic data, and information about a visitor\u2019s referral source to a particular website. Mediavine Partners may also create unique IDs to create audience segments, which are used to provide targeted advertising.<\/p>\n<p>If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices to opt-in or opt-out of this data collection, please visit <a href=\"https:\/\/thenai.org\/opt-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">National Advertising Initiative opt out page<\/a>. You may also visit <a href=\"http:\/\/optout.aboutads.info\/#\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Digital Advertising Alliance website<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/optout.networkadvertising.org\/#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Network Advertising Initiative website<\/a> to learn more information about interest-based advertising. You may download the AppChoices app at <a href=\"https:\/\/youradchoices.com\/appchoices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s AppChoices app<\/a> to opt out in connection with mobile apps, or use the platform controls on your mobile device to opt out.<\/p>\n<p>For specific information about Mediavine Partners, the data each collects and their data collection and privacy policies, please visit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mediavine.com\/ad-partners\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Mediavine Partners<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Cookies<\/h2>\n<p>Cookies are only used to help manage internal analytics and some programmatic advertising, although none of this data has any PII (personal identifying information) and it&#8217;s only used to track website performance.<\/p>\n<p>We do have a login system that uses 1st party cookies in the browser to keep you logged into the website, but this is only used to store a logged-in session. This has no other information associated with it at all, and it behaves exactly the same as logging into any other MediaWiki-style website.<\/p>\n<h2>Data Sharing<\/h2>\n<p>We have no personal information on any individual visitor, so we do not know your name, e-mail, address, or anything about you personally. Therefore it is impossible for us to share any actual personal data with any other party, because we (UnboundWiki.com) do not collect or store any uniquely identifying personal data about any of our visitors.<\/p>\n<p>Our website analytics may be shared to an ad partner platform who manages Prebid for a programmatic ad stack. But this is only used for analytics dashboard data such as total sessions\/pageviews, countries with the most visits, and pages with the most visits. It does not include any personal data on any specific visitor or session, and as such this means we do not have any personal data to share with any advertising companies. Any data used for personalized ad targeting is done through separate entities such as Google, Facebook, or browser history like in Google Chrome. Please note that any of the companies listed can still track your visits to this website even if we are not tracking anything &#8211; this is because Chrome itself can track this data (for example), and we cannot control which browser you use to browse this website. <\/p>\n<p>If you have any data tracking concerns we&#8217;d suggest using Incognito Mode or using a proxy to browse. In either case, we still would only collect the same anonymized data of page visits &#038; countries of origin (or proxy\/IP origin) which is only used to help us improve our website&#8217;s UX and to understand user behaviors on the website itself. <\/p>\n<h2>Data Retention<\/h2>\n<p>Anonymized browsing data is saved via Google Analytics for an indefinite period, however this data is never personalized and always anonymized. This data might include broad metrics like which pages are most visited, which countries visit this wiki the most, and how long is spent on any given page. <\/p>\n<p>But none of this data is attached to any PII, so it cannot be sold or shared to some other 3rd party because it has no identifying valuable information. It is only used for internal metrics to help us improve the website&#8217;s UX, and to understand which topics are most popular with visitors.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Programmatic Ads<\/h2>\n<p>This wiki may run programmatic advertising to maintain costs of paying contributors to submit content to this wiki (yes, we do pay for content that&#8217;s contributed here).<\/p>\n<p>There may be periods where we have ads completely disabled with no ads running. In this case there is no programmatic ad data at all, and this section would largely be inactive. <\/p>\n<p>If we do have any programmatic advertising on the website, then you can see a transparency report of which ad platforms are authorized to sell the inventory in an <a href=\"https:\/\/unboundwiki.com\/ads.txt\">ads.txt here<\/a>. If that link 404&#8217;s then we do not have any programmatic ads running.<\/p>\n<p>Some programmatic ad partners may collect basic anonymized information on requests such as IP addresses, browser type (desktop\/mobile), and country location data to serve personalized ads. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices to opt-in or opt-out of this data collection, please visit <a href=\"https:\/\/thenai.org\/opt-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/thenai.org\/opt-out\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Unbound Wiki <strong>does not collect, and does not have the capacity to collect, any of this personal browsing history data<\/strong>. Other than data on which pages you visit, we do not have any other data saved on our servers or databases at all. When you visit our website we only know that you&#8217;ve visited due to our Analytics, and due to anonymized server logs which run automatically on any Debian\/Ubuntu\/Linux web server. And that doesn&#8217;t tell us anything about you beyond which pages were visited and from which country\/area of origin, which could be masked with a proxy. Personalized ads are served via SSPs\/DSPs which run their own separate tech that operate completely separately from Unbound Wiki.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Google has their own ad exchange (AdX) which can use your logged-in Google account information to personalize ads. This is not something that Unbound Wiki has any control over, because it&#8217;s based on the browser you&#8217;re using and whether you&#8217;re logged into Google in that browser. To disable Google&#8217;s personalized ads you can visit <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/My-Ad-Center-Help\/answer\/12155656#turn-on-or-off-personalized-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this page<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns about any of this then you can contact us <a href=\"https:\/\/unboundwiki.com\/contact\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Who we are Unbound Wiki is a fan-made informational database of the fan game Pok\u00e9mon Unbound.
