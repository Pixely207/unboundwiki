During normal play of the game your Pok\u00e9mon will evolve, but it\u2019s likely you haven\u2019t reached that magic number even if you\u2019ve been grinding for a while.<\/p>\n<p>The Mission Log will help keep track of how many you\u2019ve already evolved and how many you need to complete it.<\/p>\n<div class=\"callout-box\">\n<strong>Note:<\/strong> Some Pok\u00e9mon can only be obtained by evolving them, so this mission is best paired with Mission #069: The National Pokedex. By catching as many Pok\u00e9mon as possible, you\u2019ll naturally get many that need to be evolved.\n<\/div>\n<p>You will often need to train them up to the level where they can evolve, or if they\u2019re like Scyther, you just need to apply an item like the Metal Coat to them directly.<\/p>\n<p>Prioritize obtaining Pok\u00e9mon that can evolve from Evolution Stones or other Evolution Items first, because that\u2019s quicker than waiting for them to reach the right level.<\/p>\n<figure>\n  <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/unboundwiki.com\/wp-content\/assets\/images\/missions\/017\/03-pokemon-unbound-1-metal-coat-gets-1-scizor.jpg\" alt=\"One Metal Coat gets one Scizor \/ Pok\u00e9mon Unbound\"><figcaption>One Metal Coat gets one Scizor<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve evolved 151 Pok\u00e9mon, return to the scientist and she\u2019ll give you a <strong>Mewnium Z<\/strong> along with the Mew to use it.<\/p>\n<table class=\"table grey center\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"2\"class=\"text-large\">Reward Pok\u00e9mon<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<td>\n      <strong>Mew<\/strong><br \/>\n      Psychic<br \/>\n      (Lv. 1)\n     <\/td>\n<td><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/unboundwiki.com\/wp-content\/assets\/images\/missions\/017\/04-pokemon-unbound-mew.png\" alt=\"\"><\/td>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/unboundwiki.com\/missions\/\" class=\"parent-page-card\">\n            <picture class=\"card-img\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/unboundwiki.com\/wp-content\/assets\/images\/2024\/07\/missions-icon.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/unboundwiki.com\/wp-content\/assets\/images\/2024\/07\/missions-icon.jpg 200w, https:\/\/unboundwiki.com\/wp-content\/assets\/images\/2024\/07\/missions-icon-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/>\t\t\t\t            <\/picture>\n            <span class=\"card-info\">\n                <span class=\"card-info__caption\">Back to:<\/span>\n                <strong class=\"wiki-title\">All Missions<\/strong>\n            <\/span>\n        <\/a>\n\n\t\t\n","protected":false},"featured_media":1605,"parent":282,"menu_order":2,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false},"categories":[11],"class_list":["post-1604","wiki","type-wiki","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-missions"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/unboundwiki.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/wiki\/1604","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/unboundwiki.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/wiki"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/unboundwiki.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/wiki"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/unboundwiki.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/wiki\/282"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/unboundwiki.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1605"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/unboundwiki.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1604"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/unboundwiki.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1604"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
